<!-- <h3>Why?</h3>
<tab1>I went backpacking across Europe all alone for 31 days post my graduation. I had never been abroad, I had barely done any research, I was on a super tight budget, I did not have any accommodation bookings, no itinerary whatsoever, I did not have an international sim card, I did not know anyone, I did not know the languages, I did not what I was going to do for a month, I did not know what lay ahead for me, I did not know anything. All I had was a flight ticket and a passport. And somehow, I never got scared even once of the unknown.<br>
<tab1>I fear the longer I have been working, the more risk-averse I have been becoming. I am no longer doing things on a whim. Impromptu weekend trips? Eh, such a hassle, make the bookings, convince people to join. Why not just sit at home and Netflix all alone? First dates these days make me nervous to the point that I end up almost not going. I have not traveled alone in more than 2 years, because OH MY GOD, what will I do alone! Go to a meetup to meet new people and try new things, eh, why bother, let me smoke up and rewatch Curb again. I have a nagging feeling it's the drudgery of a corporate routine that is knocking away the sense of wonder and adventure in me, one bit at a time.<br>
<tab1>I fear I will wake up at 40 one day with a belly full of regret. I have never liked the idea of being stuck at the same place doing the same thing over and over again. I fear if I do not do anything about it soon, I will end up being a kupamanduka, a frog in a well, which would be quite tragic.<br>
<tab1> That is why I decided to create a bucketlist. Checking things off regularly might help me in keeping sane enough.<br> -->
