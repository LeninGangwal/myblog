<!-- I had to think for a long while to write about myself, which is a bit ironic.<br> -->
<h4>Why this website?</h4>
I read books, and I always find myself dumbfounded by an author's ability to create life with words. I want to learn to write, and I figured maybe the fear of posting things online might help me hone my writing skills, and hence this website.<br>
<h4>What do I like?</h4>
My interests are in a constant churn, and they can vary from playing keyboard to cardistry to running to software development to photography, and then some.<br>
