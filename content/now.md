<h4>Nov, 2020</h4>
<tab1>I have been in Patna for around 6 months. A lot has happened. But, the initial dissatisfaction of wasting my life here has evaporated away. I put in the effort of getting in touch with my old friends a month ago, and life has been entertaining enough since that. I gave a shot to online dating at the same time and got in touch with a couple of fairly interesting people. Tinder isn't so bad after all, I should have got on it way before. Or maybe not, online dating is actually quite a high effort game.<br>
<tab1>Pandemic has got me bored enough to set up a personal website. Frontend is a pain. I finally got myself a mirrorless a few weeks ago. I wanted to get into shooting videos(I have some cool ideas), but now I feel photography is super interesting too. I couldn't give two shits about landscapes and monuments and wildlife, but street photography seems uber-cool stuff. So anyway, I have my work cut out for the next few months, learn the ABCs of photography. If not, hey I can always use the auto mode.<br>
<tab1>I have started reading again after quite some time. I read a few interesting books, most of them primarily revolving around Mindfulness and Stoicism, anything to help get a grip. My top 2 have to be The Practicing Stoic and Peace Is Every Step. I also loved Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain, what a fascinating guy he was. <br>
<tab1>I have finally booked tickets to go to Bangalore end of this month, 
meet some friends, get drunk, and whatnot. Well, okay not just friends, I am also hoping to go out for a coffee with someone I think I like. Let's see how it goes, fingers crossed.<br>
<tab1>I also joined a new firm remotely a few months ago. Do I like it? Well, the jury is still out. Good thing is they have a 3 month severance.
